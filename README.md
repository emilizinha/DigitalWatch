### About 📝
##### 🔹In this document I tested my skills with HTML, CSS and JavaScript technologies. I intend to add extra features to the watch, so I consider it unfinished! With it I was able to put into practice knowledge about *let and const* in JavaScript and train styling in css with the *background and box* functionalities.
